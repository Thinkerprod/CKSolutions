      <article class="about-me text-sm-center text-md-start fw-normal fs-3">I gained interest in web development at a young age. 
      It was re-sparked in 2015, when I took a 2 year program in coding at a community college. 
      Since then I have been challenging myself with different projects and working with different people. 
      I greatly enjoy front-end development and creating sites from scratch. 
      To me, web development is a great middle ground between my artistic skills and technical mind.
